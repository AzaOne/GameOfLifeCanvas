# GameOfLifeCanvas

A cellular automaton simulation game based on John Horton Conway's "Game of Life". This game is implemented using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or live demo [here](https://azaone.github.io/GameOfLifeCanvas/).
2. Click on any cell to bring it to life or kill it.
3. Click on the "Random" button to create a random pattern.
4. Click on the "Start" button to start the simulation.
5. Click on the "Stop" button to stop the simulation.
6. Click on the "Step" button to advance the simulation by one step.
7. Watch as the cells live and die according to the rules of the game.

## Game Rules

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Have fun!
